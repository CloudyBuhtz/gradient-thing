# Gradient Thing

## What is this?
A little tool to generate radial gradients using shapes as a basis

## What does it do?
Essentially, it draws the shape smaller and smaller while adjusting the greyscale shade in order to generate a gradient

## Why does this exist?
Using a simple shader with a cutoff you can make little transition animations, I wanted a csutom one with a star and finding / creating a star shaped gradient was a pain so this was born.
